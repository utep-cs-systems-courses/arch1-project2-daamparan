#Project 2
To begin the timerLib directory, its files, methods, and make file are all the
same from the examples given by Dr. Freudenthal
The make file is ran the same except with the exceptions of adding my program
etc.

#To Begin
Project is seperated into 4 different directories. 3 of them you are all
familiar with as they are exactly as those Dr. Freudenthal gave us in the
demos.
BlinkBuzz contains my project which within has make file as well.

#Within BlinkBuzz
After running the make file in the previous directory (project), run make all
in the current directory.
From there make load to use with your msp430 plugged in of course
Make clean is also available for the make file

#Using Program
All four buttons are active each with their own pattern of LEDS as well as a
sound frequency with each state.
State 1 is Sw1 and so on for all four buttons

#Future Plans
Within the next few days an implementation of a song will be attempted as well
as the assembly portion of the code
